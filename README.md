# Image-Super-resolution-using-SR-GAN
The SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) project aims to upscale low-resolution images into high-resolution images by learning fine texture details from the dataset. The model leverages deep learning techniques, primarily GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), to generate high-quality, photo-realistic images.

Key technologies include PyTorch for building the model, the DIV2K dataset for training high quality images, PIL for image processing. The Adam optimizer is used to train both the generator and discriminator networks.
